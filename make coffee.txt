//Algorithm: Make coffee

// Tasks:
// Ask if Coni wants coffee
// Boil water
// Weight grains
// Grind grains
// Put ground coffee in the french press
// Pour hot water over the french press
// Wait 4 minutes
// Serve coffee on cups

//Pattern recognition:
// Coni always drinks less coffee than Matías
// Coni always use the small cup
// Matías always use the large cup
// If Coni wants coffee, weight 25 grams of coffee beans
// If Coni doesn't want coffee, weight 18 grams of coffee beans
// Always boil 1 lt of water
// Always grind coffee
// Always put ground coffee into the french press
// If Coni wants coffee, pour 750 ml of boiled water into the french press
// If Coni doesn't want coffee, pour 450 ml of boiled water into the french press
// Always wait for 4 minutes for the coffee to infuse
// Always pour 450 ml of coffee into the large cup
// If Coni wants coffee, pour 300 ml into coffee on the small cup

// Abstraction:
// None?

//Sequence: 
//  1. Event 1: Boil water.
//  2. Event 2: Weigh coffee beans.
//  Conditional: If (Coni wants coffee) { 
//					Weigh 25g of coffee beans 
//					} else { 
//					Weigh 18g of coffee beans 
//					} 
//  3. Event 3: Grind coffee.
//  4. Event 4: Put ground coffee into the french press.
//  5 Event 5: Pour boiled water into the french press.
//  Conditional: If (Coni wants coffee) {
//                  Pour 750 ml of boiled water
//                  } else {
//                  Pour 450 ml of boiled water
//                  }
//  6. Event 6: Wait.
//	Loop: for (each 1 to 4 minutes) {
//				wait 1 minute 
//				} 
//  7. Event 7: Take large cup
//  Conditional: If (Coni wants coffee) { 
//					Take also small cup
//					} 
//	8. Event 8: Fill the cup with coffee
//	Loop: for (each empty cup) {
//			    fill the cup with coffee 
//				}
